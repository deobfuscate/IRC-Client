# IRC Client
An IRC client made in C#. The goal of this project is to take an old protocol like IRC and make a more modern client, like other chat clients such as Discord. On the networking side the IRC connections are made using asynchronous TCP sockets. The IRC interpreter is a custom one written using C#'s event handling. The UI is rendered to an HTML canvas rather than a text box or a rich text box, giving more control over how the information is displayed.
